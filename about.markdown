Cloud Computing is going to make a profound impact on telecommunication. Traditionally, most telecom applications had been implemented on custom built hardware, for perfromance reasons. However, the recent developments in cloud computing has enabled us to run those applications on [COTS] hardware; which forms the basis for [NFV].

While [NFV] is an attractive technology development, reaping its real benefits is challenging for the Telcos who are well accustomed to their current operational practices. [NFV] transformation demands not only an upgrade of the technical skills of people, but also a significant change in the organizational structure and processes.

[CloudQubes] [cloudqubes] provides resources for telecom engineeres to enhance their skills on NFV, cloud computing, and get prepared for the technology transformations in future.
