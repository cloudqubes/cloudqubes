purpose  - inform telco senior managers, that the right NFV architecture is essential for succeeding the 5G quest.

**If the telcos are to reap the real beneifts of 5G, NFV is a must. But, it's not enough. It (NFV) has got to be programmable.**

NFV can deliver [several benefits] ({% post_url 2019-10-20-benefits-of-nfv }) on existing 3G and 4G networks, by improving agility and time to market. However, NFV is more of a nice-to-have than a necessity for these networks, which are designed to deliver a limited set of predefined services.

In contrast, 5G inherits more programmability. 5G system - yes, unlike 3G or 4G, it's a system - exposes multiple integration points via HTTP APIs, which are called service based interfaces. This architecture enables 3rd party applications to utilize the telcom network as a platform, and has the potential to disrupt the whole telcom industry. 

Back in 2007, the introduction of the smart phone triggered a similar disruption. It opened up the mobile phone to the world to develop and run applications. Since then, individual developers and companies have come up with countless use cases for mobile applications, that original creators of the smart phone had never even imagined.

With the service based architecture, 5G system has similar potential, but it will essentailly depend on a robust infrastructure that allows dynamic deployment of applications. NFV is the perfect answer for this. 

However, in order to realize a fully programmable 5G system, a programmable NFV infrastructure is a mandatory requirement. While not very relevant for consumer services, such infrastructure would be indispensable in the enterprise arena where the most number of usecases for 5G exists. 

Open APIs are a key enabler for programmability. In order to be programmable, an NFV platform must expose all its capabilities via APIs, so that an upper layer orchestrator could create virtual infrastructure and deploy applications without manual intervention. With a robust orchestration architecture and open APIs, NFV is capable of implementing a platform for running telecom applications of any complexity, across data centers from network edge to the core.

However, some telcos approach NFV just from the aspect of virtualizing their legacy hardware based PNFs. Such an approach places little focus on programmability and orchestration features, and resulting NFV infrastructure would be incapable of realizing benefits in 5G.
